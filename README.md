# Herman-Miller-Gallery
Image gallery displaying the Herman Miller Eames chair<br>
Responsive splash page that shows the details of the Herman Miller Eames plastic side chair.<br>
I have never had a project where I manipulated the DOM(in vanilla js) so I thought I would hop on that, Sometimes you get so caught up in more advanced topics that you forget about the basics that are the foundation of the language.<br>
Click on the thumbnail image to display it as the current(large) image in the gallery.<br>
